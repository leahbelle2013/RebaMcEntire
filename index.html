        <p>McEntire was born in McAlester, Oklahoma, in 1955 but was raised on a ranch in Chockie, Oklahoma. She was
            the third of four children born to Clark (1927 to 2014) and Jacqueline McEntire (1926 to 2020). Her
            grandfather, John Wesley McEntire, was a world-champion steer roper in 1934, while her father held the
            same title three times (1957, 1958 and 1961). Jacqueline McEntire had aspirations of becoming a country
            singer, but instead became a public school teacher, librarian and secretary. The McEntire family owned a
            cattle ranch in Chockie. Each family member contributed to running the cattle operation. The McEntire
            children helped with ranch chores before and after school. This included castrating bulls and giving
            them worm medicine.</p>
        <p>The McEntire siblings also developed an interest in singing, which was encouraged by their mother. On car
            trips to their father's rodeo dates, Jacqueline McEntire taught her children to sing in harmony with one
            another. Young Reba then started performing at school, beginning in first grade when she sang "Away in a
            Manger" at an elementary school Christmas pageant. In fifth grade, she joined the 4-H club and won first
            place in the Junior Act Division for singing "My Sweet Little Alice Blue Gown". She also played
            basketball and ran track. For several summers, she attended a basketball camp. She also learned piano
            and guitar. She also developed an interest in the rodeo and trained to become a barrel racer.</p>
        <p>Once finishing high school, McEntire enrolled in college at Southeastern Oklahoma State University. She
            majored in elementary education with a minor in music. She completed student teaching and later
            graduated with a Bachelor's degree. She also continued to help out on her family's ranch during her
            college years.</p>
